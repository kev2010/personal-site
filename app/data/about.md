### Intro
I'm an MIT undergraduate student studying 6-3 Computer Science and Engineering. Projected to graduate in 2022, I aim to continue working on impactful tech projects to better serve those around us. My ultimate goal is to build my own startup, and I'm currently learning more about web development and machine learning. Outside of work, I lead two clubs: MIT Poker Club (Co-President) and MIT Engineering Innovation Group (Cofounder). I also love to do Taekwondo in my spare time and have been competing and coaching both nationally and internationally for many years.
<br><br>
I am always available to explore interesting projects. I have an interest in a wide variety of industries: social, education, fintech, real estate, etc. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Boston, but happy to travel anywhere :).
